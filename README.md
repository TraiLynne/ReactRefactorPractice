# ReactRefactor

**ReactRefactor** is a personal project aimed at keeping my React skills sharp by refactoring class components into modern functional components using hooks. This repository serves as a playground for practicing and mastering the latest React concepts, focusing on transitioning from older class-based components to functional ones.

## Overview

This project contains a variety of React class components that I've written and then refactored into functional components. It includes basic examples like counters and forms, as well as more interactive ones like a todo list and user profile. The aim is to stay up-to-date with React's best practices and gain deeper familiarity with hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and more.

## Installation

To run this project locally, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ReactRefactor.git
cd app
npm install || yarn
```

## Components

Here are the components available for refactoring practice:

1. **Counter** - A simple counter with increment and decrement functionality.
2. **Todo List** - Allows users to add, view, and manage tasks.
3. **User Profile** - Simulates fetching user data and displaying it.
4. **Weather** - Displays a simulated temperature reading.
5. **Toggle** - A basic on/off toggle button.
6. **Form** - A controlled form handling user input.
7. **Click Counter** - Counts the number of button clicks.
8. **Message** - Displays a simple message.
9. **Color Picker** - Changes text color based on user selection.
10. **List Display** - Renders a list of items.

Each component is implemented as a class component and then refactored into a functional component, providing a side-by-side comparison for learning purposes.

## Project Goals

- **Practice Refactoring**: Gain confidence in converting class components to functional components.
- **Master Hooks**: Deepen understanding of hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom hooks.
- **Stay Updated**: Keep up with modern React practices and ES6+ JavaScript.
- **Code for Fun**: Enjoy coding and experimenting with different approaches without the pressure of deadlines or external requirements.

## Usage

To run the project locally and see the components in action, use the following command:

```bash
npm start || yarn start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the app. You can explore each component's functionality and refactoring approach directly from the app.
